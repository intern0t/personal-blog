After a year long use of [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), I decided to move to Jekyll and give it a try. I am loving the full developer feel while using Jekyll, especially while setting it up and designing a custom theme. I love it's extendibility. I can develop and use my own custom features, plugins, in short, no more bulky and slow performance.

Designing a theme for Jekyll is so much fun, it had been a while I had not wireframed the frontend and the backend, I consider it a headache, even now! Simple designing a website or just developing a backend is easy, wireframing both together to create a complete product is a whole different ball game, interesting too.

I am quite glad, I had short but complicated experience with Ghost Blog, both uses [Liquid Templating](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) developed by [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). Besides the boring part, you write the blog post or pages in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), how cool is that? I mean, it's not really new as almost every repositories now a days use Markdown for project pages, including `README.md`.

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. As the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown appeared over the years to answer these issues.

I decided to integrate [Lightcase](http://cornel.bopp-art.com/lightcase/) to my theme because it was very simple and easy to use, I could create my own but maybe in the future!
