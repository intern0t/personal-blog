After successfully installing [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) in my Ubuntu for my desktop, I noticed enormous icons in my files that has iconic fonts or symbols in them. What threw me off was that it was very difficult to figure out why because the text itself was perfectly scaled but the symbols weren't. 

For example ..
