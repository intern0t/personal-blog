##### Prashant Shrestha

I am a 22 years old full-time University Student, majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I was born and raised in a small city named [Kathmandu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu), [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal) and moved to the [United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) in 2009. I, sometimes work as a freelancer during my free time where I design and develop Android Applications, Web Applications, Windows applications and small scripts. I work on my personal projects as well, in order to build a proper resume to display my knowledge and experience in the development field, I believe it to be equally important as my G.P.A.

I started programming since I was 11 years old, started off with writing `bat` scripts and learned how to code in no time once I found out about internet and Google. I always had an interest in designing and developing applications, whether it be Windows, Linux or MacOS. I also love playing PC games and have experienced vast awesomeness of new games. I also believe **game-play** and **story-line** are the most important things in a game. The first games I played were Super Mario, Diablo (1 & 2), Warcraft (Frozen Throne) and [Dota 2](http://www.dota2.com/play/). Besides developing applications, I love reading [Comic Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book) and [watching movies]({% post_url 2017-02-02-running-a-local-media-server-using-plex %}) during my free time.
